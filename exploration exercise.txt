I spent some time exploring x.com using my browser’s developer tools, and it was really interesting to see how the website is structured. One thing I noticed is that the main menu items, like “Home,” “Explore,” and “Notifications,” are built using a list of <div> and <a> elements that are styled to look like buttons. I also saw that many images on the site have alternative text (alt text), which helps screen readers describe the content for people who are visually impaired. Another cool thing was that some parts of the code had comments from developers, which explain why certain sections exist or how they work. Even though I didn’t understand everything, it was exciting to see how all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to make the site interactive and responsive. It made me more comfortable using developer tools and exploring the structure of web pages.
